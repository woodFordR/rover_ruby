        I was born in the great city of Philadelphia, PA and landed in
        Lexington, KY with horses üèá and bourbon ü•É. I've been here since
        2015 and have no regrets. I'm a father && chocolate lab owner &&
        devops, backend, software engineer. I enjoy exercising at the gym,
        meditation, yoga, golf, volleyball, great sushi, local new food, and
        all things green. I've worked for several startup companies. I took a
        risk in moving to Kentucky with only a suitcase before working from
        home became a popular option. I've been through many challenges, both
        personally and career related, which have tested my resilience many
        times. Yet, I always find a way towards a solution when change is
        required. I continue to show up in the face of adversity due to my
        internal motivation and strong work ethic, regardless if the job is
        in-person or remote. I'm a passionate, dedicated person who remains
        compassionate about solving complex problems, working alongside a
        motivated team, and learning new skills along my journey.
