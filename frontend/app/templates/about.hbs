          I was born in the great city of Philadelphia, PA and landed in
          Lexington, KY with horses üèá and bourbon ü•É. I've been here since
          2015 and have no regrets. I'm a father && chocolate lab owner &&
          devops, backend, software engineer. I enjoy exercising at the gym,
          meditation, yoga, golf, volleyball, great sushi, local new food, and
          all things green. I've worked for several startup companies which is
          why I took a risk in moving here before working from home became
          popular. I show up regardless if the job is in person or remote. I'm
          a passionate, dedicated bot who remains compassionate about solving
          difficult problems, team work to make the dream work, and learning
          new tools and skills along the journey.
