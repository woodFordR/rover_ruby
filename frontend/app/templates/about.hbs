        @cardDescription="I was born in the great city of Philadelphia, PA
      and landed in Lexington, KY with horses 🏇 and bourbon 🥃. I've been
      living here since 2015. I'm a father && chocolate lab owner && devops,
      backend, software engineer. I enjoy exercising at the gym, meditation,
      hot yoga, golf, volleyball, great sushi, local new food, and all
      things green. I've worked for several startup companies. I took a risk
      in moving to Kentucky with only a suitcase before working from home
      became a popular option. I've been through many challenges, both
      personally and career related, which have tested my resilience many
      times. Yet, I always find a way towards a solution when change is
      required. I continue to show up in the face of adversity due to my
      internal motivation and strong work ethic, regardless if the job is
      in-person or remote. I'm a passionate, dedicated person who remains
      compassionate about solving complex problems, working alongside a
      motivated team, and learning new skills along my journey."

        @cardDescription="From October 2024 until June 2025, I helped build a
      Textual Python application which connected a user to their simulated
      network that was emulated on our platform, deployed with Pulumi, and
      connected by a Firecracker to a AWS bare metal server. It provided a
      secure, quick connection without gaining access to sensitive data."
